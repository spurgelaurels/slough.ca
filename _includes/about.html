              <h2>About The Slough of Despond</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>Built in 1912, 235 Kensington Ave North was a church apparently built upon a muddy mire in East Hamilton. In the 1930s, a journalist for the Hamilton Herald called the building and congregation a "success", noting that it had been built from "the Slough of Despond".</p>

                <p>In 2019, the church was purchased by Rachel and Daphne, and has become home to several artistic, musical, and community events.</p>
