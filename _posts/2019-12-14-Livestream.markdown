With COVID-19 disrupting the local music scenes everywhere, we decided to shift our focus away from in-person performances and move into the world of livestreaming. The Slough teamed up with local media pros Melodic Pixel Media, and live-visual experts Realtime Activities, and the Safe & Sound Premium Livestream Series was born.

High Definition cameras, high quality microphones, and a team of creative yet technically skilled individuals will bring this setting to life to deliver a professional quality capture of your performance for livestreaming or a take-away product. 

With 4,000+ sqft of space, we can design a set, spread out, get comfortable, and perform all while staying within the safety protocols required to keep everyone healthy.
