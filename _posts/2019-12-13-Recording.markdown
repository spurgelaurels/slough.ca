The Slough is home to a fully equipped and functional recording studio, along with the space to allow you to spread out and configure the room as needed. Drums, guitar amps, synthesizers, professional microphones, and what church wouldn't have a Hammond organ with a Leslie? 

We have 15+ years of production experience, and can help you shape your idea into a final product from recording, to production, to mastering, and even distribution. Or you can rent the space and gear yourself and have at it!
