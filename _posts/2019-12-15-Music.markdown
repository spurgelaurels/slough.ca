Every now and then, we may host a music show ourselves. Stay tuned to our Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/sloughofdespond/> for details and announcements!

In the times of COVID 19, we have re-configured our space to facilitate livestreaming musical and artistic performances. Catch our streams and recordings on our Twitch account at <https://www.twitch.tv/thesloughofdespond> and make sure to follow us for notifications. 

If you want to book a livestream show, reach out to us at salut@slough.ca
